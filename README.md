## About Me

I'm currently taking the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification and enrolled in the **ALX Backend ProDev** program. My journey into software engineering is driven by a passion for building robust, scalable systems and a vision to become an **ML Ops Engineer** â€” someone who ensures machine learning models run reliably in real-world environments.

Even as I begin, Iâ€™m already thinking ahead:

- **Automated Model CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Model Monitoring & Drift Detection**
- **Centralized Experiment Registries**
- **Scalable Real-Time Inference Endpoints**

I believe in learning with purpose â€” and building with impact.
